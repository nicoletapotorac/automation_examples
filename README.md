# create-profile
A collection of automation scripts using Selenium, TestNG and AutoIT.
This is an example of how to automate a create user profile scenario. It uses as test page the one provided by softwaretestingplace.com (baseURL = http://softwaretestingplace.blogspot.com/2015/10/sample-web-page-to-test.html#http://softwaretestingplace.blogspot.com/p/automation-testing.html)
I chose it because it illustrates most of the challenges of creating a user profile, including uploading/downloading a file.
It is my way of solving these issues and it was uploaded to provide an example. It is by no means a "best practice" or "the right way to do it", so use it at your own discretion.
